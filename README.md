## ColDoc - A Collaborative Text Editor

ColDoc is a fully functional collaborative online text editor in the browser, comparable to strongly simplified variants of Overleaf or Google Docs, for instance. It is important to note that this was a project intended for learning the basics of
web-development and using tools/languages such as NPM, Node.js, socket.io, Javascript, Typescript and databases such as MongoDB. In particular, we do not claim originality.

To build the website in a development environment, first run `cd path/to/folder` and next run `npm run dev` in the terminal. The website is available at `http://localhost:3000`.
